Hi!
I am Marko, a developer from Croatia currently studying at FER, Zagreb.
I am mostly experienced in Android app development using both Java and Kotlin. Have experience using Google's Firebase tools.

Interested in Deep Learning, but because of heavy computing power needed to dabble with it, I am currently focusing on Android app development.

I have published one app at Google Play Store. It's called [Kvizomat](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.markojerkic.kvizomat). It is a quiz app in Croatian. It is built using Google's Firebase tools and Java.
Currently working on a new app which would help students prepare for Croatian college entrance exams.
